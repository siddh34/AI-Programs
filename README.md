This will be some exercises that I will be performing using java

### Activity 1 

8 puzzle problem in java 

Implemented algorithms: 
1. A * star (time complexity O(n) where n is number of edges)
2. ManHatthan Algorithm (time compelxity is O(log(min(a,b)))
3. Tree generation time complexity (O(n) where n is number of iterations)
